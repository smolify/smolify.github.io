# United by our values

We’re building a company that’s focused not just on the bottom line, but also on the happiness of our customers and team. Here are the values that guide our decisions and actions:

---

### 📖 Default to transparency

Our true North Star. Transparency is the value we’re best known for, and yet, still very aspirational. We aspire to always default to transparency as a company and as individuals in our decisions and actions.

**How we default to transparency**

*   We choose transparency as a lifestyle of authenticity and honesty, as well as an effective way to work remotely and establish a culture of trust.
*   We believe our transparency will help others as well.
*   We share early in the decision process to avoid “big revelations.”
*   We strive to make all communication clear and avoid making assumptions.

### ⬆️ Improve consistently

Improving consistently is about striving to be better, not in competition with anyone but our yesterday selves. We are committed to working every day toward personal and professional growth.

**How we improve consistently**

*   We try to make Smolify a little bit better every day in whatever domain we can.
*   We choose to be where we are the happiest and most productive.
*   We desire to be better every day and know that improvement can be found in small changes.
*   We strive to exemplify a growth mindset and believe that any skill or talent can be learned through practice.

### ⛵ Be a no-ego doer

We don’t attach our personal selves to ideas. We remove ourselves—our fears, our pride—from our work to lead to a better, more productive experience for us and everyone around us. We’re all rowing this boat together.

**How we are no-ego doers**

*   We consider the bigger picture and practice humility, knowing our work goes beyond ourselves.
*   We are adaptable and comfortable making decisions and working in uncertainty.
*   We advocate for diverse perspectives to make our team and products stronger.
*   We have a bias towards action. Done well today is better than done perfectly next week.

### 💛 Show gratitude

This value is deeply ingrained in our culture. We regularly show gratitude for each other, for the technology to make this company and life possible, and for the many blessings that Smolify brings to our lives.

**How we show gratitude**

*   We regularly demonstrate gratitude for our circumstances.
*   We approach customer conversations with the knowledge that it’s a privilege to serve them.
*   We are grateful for the work teammates do to push the company forward.
*   We view it as our duty to give back to help others the way we’ve been supported by many individuals, platforms, and communities.

### 🥛 Choose optimism

Choosing optimism is foundational to Smolify’s kind and joyful culture. Optimism helps us look to the future with positivity, while embracing hard conversations and decisions in service of Smolify’s health and future.

**How we choose optimism**

*   We strive to approach everything with optimism about the potential outcome.
*   We assume the best of others because we may lack full context.
*   We believe that constructive, honest feedback is an investment in growth.
*   We push through any artificial harmony.
*   We find joy and fun in the ups and downs of startup life.

### 🪞 Reflect to unblock

We carve out time for reflection in order to unblock ourselves. We believe personal growth stems from vulnerability and introspection as we focus on ongoing self-improvement.

**How we reflect to unblock**

*   We deliberately find time for reflection; we believe this is where life-changing adjustments come from.
*   We find the time to jump out of the trenches into higher-level thinking that will move the needle.
*   We understand the value of patience and treat it as a muscle, which needs practice to grow.
